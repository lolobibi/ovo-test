# Rock Paper ScissorThis little project has two sides: 1. **rps-core**: game logic library that describes the principle of Match and Game. 2. **rps-spa**: single page application (very limited one, no remote connection).**WARNING:** **rps-spa** depends on **rps-core**, please make sure you read the README.md within **rps-spa**.**SECOND WARNING:** **rps-spa** is NOT RESPONSIVE, though it works on device, it won't apply any responsive design pattern(media queries).**SECOND WARNING BIS:** **rps-spa** is VERY UGLY looking!!!Right, so now you are warned, here is what I aimed at: - creating a logic side, like a library, that could potentially be used both front-end and back-end (multiplayer for instance, but that is for later). - sharing my preference for the French version of Rock Paper Scissor, which is just different as it adds an extra element (a Well, which provides a new balance, greater for mind game). - using **es6** on a concrete case (for the joy of it but also the annoyances). - using **flux** on a concrete case - experience the DOM limitation for creating games as opposed to canvas/game-engine.Enjoy!
