# Rock Paper Scissor, game logic## Technologies Stack- **es6** style (still some **es5** bits)- **Node**: take advantage of a few modules and of the environment.- **mocha / chai**: unit test- **webpack**: quick dev/build process.## BuildTo initialise the project, run:````$ npm install````To run the tests````$ npm run test````## In a nutshell - a set of Rules defines a Game. - a series of Round defines a Match between two players. - a Match is played according to a Game.Hence, the project has a **rules** package with classes within that are used by the classes defined in the **games** package.At the root live the definition of Round and Match.This is not thoroughly unit tested, but quite sufficiently for a good confidence level.
